I was also willing to take a sacrifice on the pay if it meant doing something I know I'd enjoy.  Most of the jobs I was mentioning have nothing to do with my research and moreover, they reached out to me.  So right away it was an uphill battle for me to become interested in working for them.  When the pay is not at least comparable to jobs I am interested in, I simply can't waste anymore of their time.  Having fallbacks, I was secure in playing it this way, and now I've settled on something I am actually passionate about.",

I was interviewing for Google, I (as a mostly self taught programmer) had to ask the interviewer to define &amp;#39;preorder traversal&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I implemented it. I got the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: To be fair, questions where you can get them just by knowing data structures from the back of a textbook tend to be pretty awful; you end up testing for memorization, and not for ability to synthesize new solutions. The latter is far better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#39;m giving interviews, I&amp;#39;m still wishing that I can find a good question where there is no optimal solution, so that I can see what kind of tradeoffs and design decisions people make as they come up with a solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Everyone remembers the concept of breadth first vs. depth first, even if they don't necessarily remember the most efficient, perfect algorithm to accomplish it. If you know what it is conceptually, you should be able to piece an algorithm together. In fact, it's better if you *don't* remember it because you'll show problem solving ability within the interview.\n\nThe problem I have with blogs like this is that you're never really sure if the writer is actually a good developer or has a good personality. They sure like to sell themselves as great, but are they? They're getting rejected in interview after interview in an industry where good developers are snatched up almost immediately. Why? Is it *really* because the interviews are unfair to them? I doubt it.\n\nEdit: \n\nFull disclosure, I do ask graph search questions in interviews for senior developer positions. However, I don't ask for a specific algorithm. I give them a tree structure and ask them to write some code to get a particular node. How they implement is completely up to them.

If you know what it is conceptually, you should be able to piece an algorithm together. In fact, it&amp;#39;s better if you &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; remember it because you&amp;#39;ll show problem solving ability within the interview.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem I have with blogs like this is that you&amp;#39;re never really sure if the writer is actually a good developer or has a good personality. They sure like to sell themselves as great, but are they? They&amp;#39;re getting rejected in interview after interview in an industry where good developers are snatched up almost immediately. Why? Is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; because the interviews are unfair to them?

But I played a bit of catch-up, so I should know the basic ones, i.e. I don&amp;#39;t want to analyze mergesort the 100th time or get told the difference between a vector and a list again. Unless it skips these basics, I won&amp;#39;t go through a intro and will just continue by fixing holes when they appear, like now with the BFS and DFS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as I said, thanks to you anyways:)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

No, I still didn\u2019t understand the question, even after hanging up the phone.\n\nSounds reasonable. The phone screen exists to weed out the people who really just can't code simple algos.\n\n&gt;  At no point was the interviewer interested in me as a potential candidate, or has asked me anything about my open-source work on GitHub and previous work experience\n\nYeah. The recruiter asks about those things. The phone screen is only a technical phone screen.\n\n&gt; if I had looked at Dijkstra\u2019s shortest path algorithm and breadth-first search one day before my interview, this would have been a trivial problem to solve from memory, but that\u2019s besides the point. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on an algorithm question lottery to demonstrate my skills and abilities during an interview. Luck and chance should not be part of the tech interview process.\n\nIf you just understood depth-first and breath-first searches, there is no luck anymore. There are roughly 2-3 dozen computational patterns that are so baseline, that you have absolutely no excuse not to know them if you want to work in software. Which order you look through 'stuff' is important, even when you're not writing maze solving software. I honestly don't know how to do a breadth-first search, but every time I need to do one, I can figure it out again.\n\n&gt; All in all, the on-site interview process took about three and a half hours, with no breaks and no lunch. By 4:30pm I was so exhausted, thirsty and hungry that I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there.\n\nSo... The author arrived at 1 pm, and expected to be fed during a 3 hour interview? This is really oddly entitled. Why would they feed you? I mean, the rest of this post is entitled too, but this is kinda the peak of the entitlement.\n\n&gt; I implement a tree-shaking algorithm. How the hell would I know? If, and when, I need to know how tree-shaking is implemented, I will go look it up.\n\nWhat if someone wants you to do something that no one has written an article on before? You're going to wait until someone blogs about how to do it before you implement it? In this question, I guarantee  that the interviewer really doesn't care at all about how to implement a tree-shaking algo. They care about how you think and come up with the answers when you don't know. If you're saying you can't think and come up with answers, that's why they didn't move forward.\n\n&gt;  implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. What the fuck?! You\u2019ve got to be shitting me. How many people can actually write BFS on the spot, without preparing for it in advance?\n\nA lot of us can. Seriously, I haven't written one in a long time, but I know I could get at least O(N) runtime, and O(N^2) memory where N is the number of nodes. If I thought about it more, I would almost certainly be able to shave some off the memory. You have 15-30 minutes for this problem, so if you come up with the crap answer in 5 minutes, you have another 10-25 minutes to fix and get the much slimmer answer.\n\n(Edit: My sloppy BFS has gotten some replies of interest. People are correct to point out that in the general case, O(N) is not possible. I was still thinking about mazes, where the connection count has a constant max that is far less than the number of nodes. This is the kind of ambiguity that inevitably comes out in technical interviews and the question is usually more how to resolve and reason through it than whether you memorize the right algos.)\n\n&gt; What relevance does it have? Absolutely none.\n\nKinda. Writing a breadth-first search has absolutely no relevance. But being *able* to write one shows an ability to work with complexity. It might be more like testing an NBA player by having them shoot at a moving hoop. It's not something they ever do in game, and it's imperfect, but what you're really testing for is ball control, which is hidden information that correlates to good basketball players. Some players might have better muscle memory for 3 point shots, and they're better ball players than your test will show. Other players are far better at shooting than running, and your test will overvalue them. The test is still testing something relevant though, even if imperfectly.\n\n&gt; We, engineers,\n\nGiven the absolute lack of confidence with basic algos, I think the title engineer is probably not deserved here.",

Like, once I asked him, &amp;quot;Hey, what should I ask this guy I&amp;#39;m interviewing this afternoon?&amp;quot; and he said, &amp;quot;Ask him to write a function to balance a red-black tree in C++ without any notes.&amp;quot; (We didn&amp;#39;t write any C++ at that place.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; would be a bit ridiculous. (I haven&amp;#39;t had to implement a red-black tree since college, and I&amp;#39;d definitely have to look up the rules on how they even work, let alone think a while about how the balancing works in one.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BFS/DFS, on the other hand, is pretty basic. I mean, if someone asks you to search a tree, you&amp;#39;re going to end up implementing one or the other naturally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
